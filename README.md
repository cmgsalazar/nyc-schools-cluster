# NYC Schools clustering


Unlike other school districts in major cities in the U.S., New York City schools tend to be so diverse that there is no outstanding race/ethnicity among students. Because of this,
trends concerning race/ethnicity are relatively trickier to explore, compared to other school districts. 

As an example, we know that high-poverty schools tend to be majority Black or Hispanic in Chicago. We also know that, when immigration raids escalate, attendance declines in schools in communities with a high Hispanic population. 

Using K-means clustering, we grouped NYC schools based on student demographic data to see which are similar in composition. 

The clustering could then be used to expand the analyses of other key education metrics, such as test scores, graduation rates, or chronic absenteeism, and explore whether trends emerge within these clusters.

Data used for this project are from the [NYC Schools website](https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/students-and-schools/school-quality/information-and-data-overview).
